# RecipeApp
RecipeApp is for developing an app by Jetpack Compose UI.
This is an offline-first application that shows a list of food on the first page.
I try to use all kinds of Jetpack Compose Features.

Features:  
    • Jetpack Compose UI (M3)  
    • Compose navigation (one activity, zero fragments)  
    • Multi Module  
    • MVVM  
    • Use cases  
    • Unidirectional Data flow  
    • Worker (Hilt Worker)  
    • Dependency Injection (HILT)  
    • Retrieve Network Data from API (REST API)  
    • Moshi JSON library  
    • Database caching (Room)  
    • Datastore (New Shared Preferences)  
    • Unit Testing  
    • MockWebServer (Okhttp)  
    • Dependency management with VersionCatalog
