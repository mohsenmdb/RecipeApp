# RecipeApp
RecipeApp is for developing an app by Jetpack Compose UI.  
This is an offline-first application that shows a list of food on the first page.  
I try to use all kinds of Jetpack Compose Features.

Features:  
Jetpack Compose UI (M3)  
Compose navigation (one activity, zero fragments)  
MVVM  
Use cases  
Unidirectional Data flow  
Worker (Hilt Worker)  
Dependency Injection (HILT)  
Retrieve Network Data from API (REST API)  
Moshi JSON library  
Database caching (Room)  
Datastore (New Shared Preferences)  
Unit Testing  
MockWebServer (Okhttp)  
Dependency management with VersionCatalog
